DKSketchBook

A rough collection of SC scripts and saved livecoding documents. With the option 
to include classses that will facilitate these practices.

Directory structure:
 - livecoding (this is the only part included in the project right now)
 - scripts
 - Classes

This is a very informal project, and so it is subject to fundamental changes in 
the future.
